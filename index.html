        <h2>LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL</h2>
        <h3>Distinguished Delegates, Observers and Esteemed Guests,</h3>
        <p>On behalf of the Secretariat, it is my distinct honour to extend to you all a welcome to first session of ATO  Model United Nations Conference.</p>
        <p>We are living in a time of inovation. With every ticking of the clock, the world is heading towards to advancement and development at a rapid pace, be it in technological progress, political reforms and medical discovery. Ceaseless changes of the planet as a result of globalization, rapid  development of technology and the armament race between countries, lead to many inevitable conclusions. Conclusions are seemingly considered as death, diseases for instance COVID-19 and war on every corner. Nevertheless it is through these times of conflict that solidarity and cooperation come forward. </p>
        <p> Therefore we, the global citizens, we should beware of theoretical illusions by going after the attainment of experience, culling knowledge from all available resources in the age of information and planning our common future with distinctive intentness.</p>   
        <p> As we pursue the ideals of the new world, we could not be expected to set history aside in determining the issues to be discussed by the next generation of leaders.ATOMUN strives to create a collaborative and professional platform for young people to grow personally and intellectually. In the first session of ATOMUN we are eager to introduce our United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Committee which will be taking place in today and focusing on the lives of refugees who were victims of the Russia-Ukraine war. And our second committee World Health Organization will be taking place in today and debating on human life after COVİD-19. And in one of our committee we will be discussing impacts of global warming. And lastly The Hunger Games committe. Our committees will introduce delegates a range of global challenges, and to provide culturally diverse perspectives on a variety of issues.  </p>
        <p>We are conference for delegates of all skill levels and MUN experience, providing opportunities for all students to improve their knowledge, develop their critical thinking skills, and improve their public speaking abilities and confidence.</p>
        <p>As the ATOMUN family, we are excited to embark on this innovative and unique journeywith you and rewarding MUN experience that would go a long way in moulding the attendees into the future leaders. We look forward to see you at ATO Model United Nations Conference in 20-21 April, 2022. I hope it will be the greatest start for ATOMUN.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p> 
            <p>Asya Gül Battal</p>
            <p>Secretary-General of ATOMUN 2022</p>

                <h2>World Health Organization</h2>
                <p>The World Health Organization was established in 1948. WHO is the United Nations agency that connects nations, partners and people to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable – so everyone, everywhere can attain the highest level of health.</p>
                <h3>Topic: Covid-19 Social and Economical Impact </h3>
                <p>Starting on the 1st of December 2019, Covid-19 caused more than 5 million deaths around the world. Different countries developed various vaccinations and with the development of these vaccines, immunity of people increased. As days pass we are getting closer to returning to our daily life before covid-19. But it won’t be the way it used to be . Countries drained all resources to battle  global pandemic , now face bankruptcy. And what about social life? In this committee, we expect you to build international bridges to propose sustainable economic and social policices.</p>

                <h2> United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</h2>
                <p>Since 1950, we have faced multiple crises on multiple continents, and provided vital assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced and stateless people, many of whom have nobody left to turn to. The UNHCR help to save lives and build better futures for millions forced from home.</p>
                <h3>Topic: Russia-Ukraine War Refugee Crises</h3>
                <p>UNHCR has declared Ukraine a Level 3 emergency – the highest level we have.  The situation remains extremely dangerous for anyone inside Ukraine and the vulnerability of those forced to flee is increasing rapidly, with more in need of immediate support. People are fleeing their homes to try to find safety elsewhere within the country and are crossing borders into neighbouring countries.  Over 5 million refugees estimated to have fled to neighbouring countries since 24 February and rising. This presents a remarkable challenge to the international community to guarantee the every innocent citizen will live in a safe, healthy and peaceful place. We expect you to come up with new and creative ideas and put your own spin into the issue in ATOMUN 2022.</p>

                <h3>Topic: Global Warming Social and Economical Impact </h3>
                <p>It is the change in the climate of the world due to the increase in the average temperature of the Earth as a result of the emmision of greenhouse gases, which are formed by the increase in the gases holding the global heat and released into the atmosphere. Global warming is increasing day by day and wreak more damage on. In this committee, we will discuss how we can prevent this situation and reduce the losses.</p>
